# Spendy - An app to keep track of all your expenses
Part of Academind's Remix.js Practical Guide but updated to be made with TypeScript and Remix v2. A site where people can keep track of their expenses. Contains user authentication so each user can only access their own expenses. Live link:

## Tools

Made with Remix (React, React Router), TypeScript.

## Features to add

- [ ] Finish app

## Stretch Goals

- [ ] Finish base app first

## Quick Start

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
